Building and Installing FS-UAE
==============================

Instructions for compiling and installing FS-UAE is available here:

Configure Options
-----------------

The configure script can be used to enable some additional features
(but they might not work or even compile) and disable default features.

Please note, the only *supported* configuration is to build with the
default option set or the ones listed below.  Other options are provided
for testing and debugging purposes - and also for your convenience, in
the cases where it happens to work ;-).

Supported options:

 * --with-libmpeg=builtin    For systems lacking libmpeg2.
 * --disable-jit             For platforms without UAE JIT support.
